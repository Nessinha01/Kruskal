# The Kruskal Algorithm
This repository a GUI for the Kruskal algorithm in `MATLAB` R2020a to solve the problem of finding a minimum span tree in a connected, un-directed and weighted graph

The GUI receives an adjacency matrix contained in a CSV file as in `adjacencyMatrix.csv`, where the entry in the _i_-th row, _j_-th column denote the weight between the _i_-th and _j_-th nodes, and 0 is used to denote that there is not an edge between the nodes. To avoid redundancy, the program admits upper and lower triangular adjacency matrices.

# Binaries for Windows
If you want to run this GUI, you may want to use the provided binaries.  
- Version 9.8 (R2020a) of the MATLAB Runtime is required.
- If you don't have the MATLb Runtime installed in your computer, go to `Binaires/for_redistribution`, download and install `MyAppInstaller_web.exe`.
